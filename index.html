My projects included eLearning and blended courses, animated videos, mobile apps, software training, and trainings of trainers. I ran projects from start to finish, worked with experts and external providers, and used a range of authoring tools and LMS platforms.</p><p><b>One of the things I love most</b> about working in e-learning is translating complex topics into simple and engaging content. I enjoy working in a team with experts and learning about new topics, and having the space to develop both my creativity and technical skills. What motivates is to help people with relevant resources and accompany them along their learning journey.</p><p><b>Taking a break from HQs</b>, I went to the field for 8 months to work for <a href="https://www.arocha.or.ke/" target="_blank">A Rocha</a>, a local conservation NGO in Kenya. I created engaging designs to promote their work and raised funds to protect threatened habitats and species. Now back in Switzerland, I am looking for new opportunities in the field of e-learning. Outside of work, you'll find me swimming in the nearest body of water, getting lost in nature looking for birds with my husband, or cooking/talking about food with friends.</p></div></section><section class="section"><div class="container"><h1 class="title">Experience</h1><hr/><div class="card"><div class="card-content"><div class="media"><div class="media-left"><figure class="image is-48x48"><a href="https://www.icrc.org/" target="_blank"><img src="d8c1ed0dfa6bc6dcae1f.jpg" alt="Placeholder image"></a></figure></div><div class="media-content"><p class="title is-4 is-spaced">International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)</p><p class="subtitle is-6">Techno-Pedagogical Engineer <time datetime="2016-7">July 2016</time> - <time datetime="2019-12">December 2019</time></p></div></div><div class="content"><p>Working in the Learning and Development Division, I managed learning initiatives liaising with internal experts and external providers.

Learners are typically spread out across the world, work in different organisations, speak various languages, and spend a lot of time in the field.</p><h4 class="title is-4">Multilingual eLearning course</h4><p>I managed external providers commissioned to design an eLearning course translated in 5 languages. I then hosted this course both on the ICRC Learning Platform and on <a href="https://ready.csod.com/ui/lms-learning-details/app/curriculum/a3225f1c-5be5-48fb-8a56-9dbbbb59fe45" target="_blank">DisasterRelief</a>, ensuring broad access across organisations.</p><img src="edb09103373d25728ad2.jpg"><h4 class="title is-4">Engaging learners with animations</h4><p>To make the Standards both more accessible and engaging, we included animations, practical examples, and formative questions.</p><img src="91c667d67bc992751cea.jpg"><h4 class="title is-4">An associated mobile app to reach field workers</h4><p>Working with another provider, we developed a mobile app including both the standards and the e-learning modules to facilitate seamless access to the standards for field workers.</p><img src="79f16b0a7b53f74349ec.jpg"><div class="caption"></div></section></div><footer class="modal-card-foot"></footer></div><div id="project-2-modal" class="modal"><div class="modal-background"></div><div class="modal-card"><header class="modal-card-head"><p class="modal-card-title">Managing Online Communities of Practice</p><button class="delete" aria-label="close"></button></header><section class="modal-card-body"><div class="tags"><span class="tag">instructional-design</span> <span class="tag">learning-path</span> <span class="tag">CrossKnowledge</span> <span class="tag">blended-learning</span></div><h4 class="title is-4">Context</h4><p>To accompany the launch of a new Communities digital platform, aspiring community managers needed training on how to set up, launch, facilitate, and manage their communities. The training had to include both technical and communication skills, and had to be available for new community managers at any time.</p><h4 class="title is-4">Combining external learning content and tailor-made resources</h4><p>Working in a team with the platform manager, we partnered with <a href="https://communityroundtable.com/" target="_blank">The Community Roundtable</a> , who provided core content through a series of short videos and quizzes. I built a blended learning path that incorporated this standardized content with tailor-made ICRC resources, case studies, and technical face-to-face workshops.</p><img src="8277034205c40291371b.jpg"><h4 class="title is-4">Work-based learning: applied exercises</h4><p>To make this training applicable and relevant, all exercises provided templates for community managers to plan and launch their community. These are a direct follow-up exercise from the video, but also constitute building blocks towards launching a community in the ICRC, directly connecting training to learners' work.</p><img src="7626b15a485863cee9d3.jpg"><h4 class="title is-4">A face-to-face workshop to receive tailored feedback</h4><p>Integrated in an asynchronous training, a monthly drop-in session offers an opportunity for learners to raise questions, share ideas and get individual help on their community.</p></section><footer class="modal-card-foot"></footer></div></div><div id="project-3-modal" class="modal"><div class="modal-background"></div><div class="modal-card"><header class="modal-card-head"><p class="modal-card-title">Performance Management and Development</p><button class="delete" aria-label="close"></button></header><section class="modal-card-body"><div class="tags"><span class="tag">instructional-design</span> <span class="tag">external-provider</span> <span class="tag">eLearning</span></div><h4 class="title is-4">Context</h4><p>To rapidly develop a training on the new Performance Management process and tool, there was a need for instructional design and managing an external provider to produce the modules.</p><h4 class="title is-4">Instructional Design</h4><p>I translated the expert's content into e-learning scenarios including key learning points, practice exercises, and storyboards.</p><img src="93b9767742772ebf8f24.jpg"><h4 class="title is-4">Quality control</h4><p>I then assisted with reviewing the content produced by the external provider, ensuring they were of high quality and in line with the organization's culture (images, characters, language, etc.)</p><img src="936c6562642a62cf0f8c.jpg"><h4 class="title is-4">Responsive modules to facilitate access</h4><p>As this training was compulsory for all staff, all the content produced was mobile-responsive and available in three languages, to make learning as ubiquitous as possible.</p><img src="88ee85ad9acbe701015a.jpg"></section><footer class="modal-card-foot"></footer></div></div><div id="project-4-modal" class="modal"><div class="modal-background"></div><div class="modal-card"><header class="modal-card-head"><p class="modal-card-title">Water and Habitat Data Training</p><button class="delete" aria-label="close"></button></header><section class="modal-card-body"><div class="tags"><span class="tag">software-training</span> <span class="tag">screen-capture</span> <span class="tag">Captivate</span></div><h4 class="title is-4">Context</h4><p>The objective of this project was to update both the content and format of an existing software training intented for staff spread out in remote locations and changing regularly due to high staff turnover. User feedback indicated that this software was perceived as ineffective and not engaging.</p><h4 class="title is-4">Animated videos starting from the learner's perspective</h4><p>Working in a team with the expert, we opened the course with a series of animated videos outlining "What's in it for me?", to increase engagement and break with the software interface itself. I used storytelling, humour and shared organizational references to create light and engaging content, in order to overcome learners' initial resistance to this topic.</p><img src="2effb2f95b43a6d4d320.jpg"><h4 class="title is-4">Simplified user interface to explain key concepts</h4><p>Animated videos lend themselves well to simplifying complex subjects, in this case, complex software interfaces. This helps learners to focus on the essential information we want to convey. I designed simplified interfaces in Adobe Illustrator and integrated them in the video production software (Vyond).</p><img src="7b1c1e8f30f98227447c.jpg"><h4 class="title is-4">Interactive modules to practice in a safe environment</h4><p>To keep learners active throughout the screencasts, we created a case study used throughout the modules of the course. Learners work on entering data from a dummy project in the application, thus practising going through all the steps needed in the software. This simulation was developed through remote collaboration with the software expert based in Belgrade, using Adobe Captivate.</p><img src="1c453828041314a8997f.jpg"></section><footer class="modal-card-foot"></footer></div></div><div id="project-5-modal" class="modal"><div class="modal-background"></div><div class="modal-card"><header class="modal-card-head"><p class="modal-card-title">Whiteboard Animations</p><button class="delete" aria-label="close"></button></header><section class="modal-card-body"><div class="tags"><span class="tag">whiteboard</span> <span class="tag">video-production</span> <span class="tag">learning-resources</span></div><h4 class="title is-4">Context</h4><p>Given the increasing complexity of organizational structures and systems, there is a growing need for translating complex subjects to a wide audience with varying levels of understanding, and find a media to replace repetitive and time-consuming face-to-face briefings.</p><h4 class="title is-4">Creating a story</h4><p>Together with content experts, I scripted and produced whiteboard animation videos summarizing the topic at hand in 5 mins maximum, using an animation software called Vyond.</p><img src="13275f25c363809a444c.jpg"><h4 class="title is-4">Adding gradual layers of complexity</h4><p>Whiteboard animations lend themselves well to progressively explain complex topics in an accessible way. In this case, I used a whiteboard animation to outline reporting requirements to field officers - overlaying both departmental and organizational requirements, with a voice guiding the viewer throughout the timeline. To ensure we account for the viewer's reality, we started with an operational project.</p><img src="5313d327e98cf55912e7.jpg"><h4 class="title is-4">A versatile learning resource</h4><p>These videos are an increasingly trendy format to communicate key messages to a large audience.

Training is therefore required to align people's understanding of resilience, and, in particular how to apply resilience to their projects.</p><h4 class="title is-4">Instructional Design</h4><p>In teamwork with experts, we defined learning objectives and designed a short online learning path introducing the topic to all staff in the Unit.</p><img src="9bd1621fff507c4a8c09.jpg"><h4 class="title is-4">Exploratory learning grounded in practical examples</h4><p>Resilience is a relatively abstract concept. To make it more concrete for learners, I developed simple interactive resources allowing learners to browse through practical case studies of ICRC projects incorporating Resilience, and help learners explore complex models such as the Resilience Framework at their own pace.</p><img src="57f8276558a3f2ee8338.jpg"><h4 class="title is-4">Videos and visual cues to simplify complex content</h4><p>I also used videos such as interviews and whiteboard animations to make the subject more approachable.

For example, we compared business intelligence to the food industry, and results-based management to a doctor's appointment. These videos successfully conveyed abstract information to a wide audience.</p><img src="6aa3e0a2c927c8b8db06.jpg"><h4 class="title is-4">Voice editing with Audacity</h4><p>Rather than robot voices, I recorded human voices to add to my videos. This significantly improves engagement.

I worked with the Community owner to design a simple graphic chart for the community space. I chose to use hand-drawn illustrations to help users view it as an informal safe space, where they feel free to exchange questions and experiences.</p><img src="b8de7e02db15a2edcb60.jpg"><h4 class="title is-4">Providing tutorials and guidelines</h4><p>I assisted Community owners by creating simple and visual guidelines for new users, outlining both the purpose and how to use the community.</p><img src="befde1e5aea265863f30.jpg"><h4 class="title is-4">Using communities as part of the learning ecosystem</h4><p>Communities of practice are a great tool to promote and complement learning programmes, whether it is reaching out to the training audience to promote content, gathering feedback on specific questions, or understanding learners' issues and work realities.</p><img src="b79c1a234a62c52f1596.jpg"></section><footer class="modal-card-foot"></footer></div></div><div id="project-9-modal" class="modal"><div class="modal-background"></div><div class="modal-card"><header class="modal-card-head"><p class="modal-card-title">NGO Communications and Fundraising</p><button class="delete" aria-label="close"></button></header><section class="modal-card-body"><div class="tags"><span class="tag">social-media</span> <span class="tag">proposal-writing</span> <span class="tag">graphic-design</span></div><h4 class="title is-4">Context</h4><p>Working with <a href="https://www.arocha.or.ke/" target="_blank">A Rocha</a>, a local conservation organization in Kenya, I was in charge of Communications and provided support to project teams in fundraising. Communications and fundraising efforts go hand in hand and are both critical to raise the support needed for the organization.</p><h4 class="title is-4">Proposal Writing and Crowdfunding Campaigns</h4><p>I led two crowdfunding campaigns, one with <a href="https://mailchimp.com/MailChimp" target="_blank">Mailchimp</a>, using infographics to convey key numbers and messages, and the other on <a href="https://www.changa.co.ke/" target="_blank">m-Changa</a>, a Kenyan crowdfunding platform. These campaigns require strong, simple messages and engaging visual imagery to raise attention. I also successfully drafted and submitted a pre-proposal to the IUCN, which led us to be selected for the second round.</p><img src="74dba191f2159a10d413.jpg"><h4 class="title is-4">Design of communication materials</h4><p>Using a graphical chart in line with the NGO's work, I designed various communication and design materials such as <a href="https://www.arocha.or.ke/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2020/08/ARK_Annual_Review_Web_compressed-1.pdf" target="_blank">Annual Reports</a>, posters, and branded objects.</p><img src="f01e782917d6d1153eca.jpg"><h4 class="title is-4">Regular communications</h4><p>To ensure regular communication, I used tools such as <a ref="https://hootsuite.com/" target="_blank">Hootsuite</a> and <a ref="https://mailchimp.com/MailChimp" target="_blank">Mailchimp</a> to organize social media posts and monthly newsletters, and drafted articles on our projects to feed the organisation's website.</p><img src="da447415f7d229ed4593.jpg"></section><footer class="modal-card-foot"></footer></div></div><footer class="footer"><div class="content has-text-centered"><p>Adapted from <a href="https://github.com/mmacneil/devfolio" target="_blank"><strong>devfolio</strong> </a>with <i class="fas fa-heart" style="color:#729460"></i> by <a href="https://github.com/Rafnuss/" target="_blank"><strong>Rafnuss</strong> </a>and hosted on <a href="https://github.com/amelinenussbaumer/amelinenussbaumer.github.io" target="_blank"><strong>Github</strong> </a>.</p></div></footer></body></html>
